<h1>Adding new nodes</h1>
<p>To add a new node, add your ssh public key, the one used by github actions and any other you need to your root account. Configure network and run the ansible playbook</p>
<h1>Ansible</h1>
<p>Ansible takes the role to provision each server with the required configs for docker, nomad and consul. It also can be used to provision new Servers</p>
<p>To run it, use the following one-liner:
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash">ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini ansible/playbook.yaml -e @static_keys.yaml --vault-password-file ansible.vault</code></pre></p>
<p>This requires the following conditions:
- The working Directory must be the project root
- your ansible inventory must contain a group called <code>main</code> that holds all IPs
- your ansible-vault file must be named <code>@static_keys.yaml</code>
- your ansible-vault password must be stored in a file valled <code>ansible.vault</code>. Don't worry, the file is in <code>.gitignore</code>.</p>
<h3>The Ansible Vault</h3>
<p>Currently it holds only one key that references the consul secret key. Its called <code>consul_encrypt_key</code></p>
<h1>CI/CD</h1>
<p>Automatic refreshment of all jobs on push is done using Github Actions. Each Action connects over tailscale with the server and runs each job
snappy:
  - dhcp
  - nomad
    - dns</p>
<p>fileserver:
  - samba</p>
<h1>Kea</h1>
<p>Ports: 8080/tcp, 67/udp, 68/udp</p>
<h1>Domains</h1>
<p>The Network exposes the following DNS Zones:
1. .apps.cyber.psych0si.is
2. .int.cyber.psych0si.is</p>
<p>Each Zone gets manually assigned by the admin with the corresponding zone configs found in the <code>bind/</code> folder. Because <code>.int.&lt;...&gt;</code> is mapped to a physical network it also has a reverse dns zone. Most of them are just CNAMES for traefik reverse proxy tho.</p>
<h1>Nomad</h1>
<p>This provisions all scheduled containers and makes sure the containers keep running across the fleet</p>
<h2>Addresses</h2>
<p>vlan id: 40</p>
<p>Mac: 7
ps4: 8</p>
<h1>Wiki</h1>
<p>Because I got a S3 server up and running I want to test it out by documenting my Network and uploading it wiki like to the buckets which should get served by a reverse proxy (traefik)</p>
